# az-rag-experiments

This is a basic Python project set up with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management and virtual environments.

## Getting Started

1. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```zsh
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Add dependencies:**
   ```zsh
   uv pip install <package-name>
   uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run your Python code:**
   ```zsh
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- `.venv/` - Python virtual environment
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies (generated by uv)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Copilot custom instructions

## Notes
